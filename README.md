# Trade Analysis

The dashboard displays Ukraine's export and import data by country. In the top-right corner, there is a slicer that allows you to filter the statistics by different years. The report is designed with cards to present total amounts, and the 'Total Balance' is calculated using a DAX measure. Stacked bar charts are used to represent export and import values by country, while stacked area charts show the dynamics of exports and imports over time. The 'Edit Interactions' tool is utilized to control interactions between the visual elements. Filters are applied to the line charts at the bottom of the report to display data for the top 5 countries.
